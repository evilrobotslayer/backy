# backy
A simple, helpful, bash based backup script with support for exporting weekly
tarballs and ageing out older daily tarballs.

Configuration of the script itself is done by modifying variables at the head
of the 'bin/backup.sh' script, and defining backup targets is done in the 
'conf/backup.include.conf' file.
